The @WomensLeagueHQ will be hosting President Ramaphosa's conversation with women. The conversation with the President has been preceded by the ANCWL NEC Lekgotla in July, which provided an opportunity for women to reflect progress made in the 25 years of democratic governance. https://t.co/nuG27dD7FZ
