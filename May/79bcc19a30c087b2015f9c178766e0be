Xoliswa Zondo, received a scholarship  to go and study medicine  in Cuba,  and says it is because of the ANC led government and ANC policies  that she was awarded this opportunity.  She's completing her studies at UKZN,  and heading to Cuba soon after that! #VoteANC #IVoteANC https://t.co/K356m6AY3F
