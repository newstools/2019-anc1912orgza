Message of support by COSAS: We here today to celebrate a life well lived by #TataWalterSisulu. We are here to remind ourselves where we come from, where we are & where we are going. We thank the people of the Free State because they voted it shows they still have hope in the ANC https://t.co/aMoEQpt5yt
